## Project Overview

This project is a real-time collaborative drawing application built with Excalidraw that allows multiple users to draw together simultaneously. The application leverages WebSockets for bidirectional communication, enabling users to see each other's cursor movements and drawing changes in real-time without page refreshes.

Key features include:

- Real-time collaboration via WebSockets connections
- Live cursor position tracking across multiple clients
- Synchronized drawing elements between users
- Persistent state management with Cloudflare Durable Objects

The architecture uses Cloudflare's infrastructure to manage WebSocket connections efficiently, broadcasting updates between clients and maintaining drawing state across sessions.

This project consists of two applications:

1. A backend service (excalidraw-backend) built with Cloudflare Workers and Durable Objects
2. A frontend application (excalidraw-multi-user-state) built with React and Excalidraw

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or later recommended)
- pnpm (for workspace management)
- Cloudflare account with Workers subscription (for deployment)

## Setup

First, install dependencies at the workspace root:

```bash
# Install all dependencies across the workspace
pnpm install
```

## Backend Setup (excalidraw-backend)

### Local Development

```bash
# Generate Cloudflare types
pnpm --filter excalidraw-backend run cf-typegen

# Start the development server
pnpm --filter excalidraw-backend run dev
```

### Deployment

```bash
# Deploy to Cloudflare Workers
pnpm --filter excalidraw-backend run deploy
```

## Frontend Setup (excalidraw-multi-user-state)

### Local Development

```bash
# Generate Cloudflare types
pnpm --filter excalidraw-multi-user-state run cf-typegen

# Start the development server
pnpm --filter excalidraw-multi-user-state run dev
```

### Building and Previewing

```bash
# Build the application
pnpm --filter excalidraw-multi-user-state run build

# Preview the built application
pnpm --filter excalidraw-multi-user-state run preview
```

### Deployment

```bash
# Deploy to Cloudflare Pages
pnpm --filter excalidraw-multi-user-state run deploy
```

## Schemas

Both applications use shared schemas from the `@workspace/schemas` package, which ensures type safety and consistency between the frontend and backend. This is managed within the pnpm workspace.
